Primary authority:

- `../constitution.md`
- `../rules/core.md`

Mandatory reads before edits:

1. `../context/architecture.md` — module boundaries and layer responsibilities.
2. `../rules/code-style.md` — naming conventions and file size limits.
3. `../rules/react.md` — component patterns, hook discipline, antd usage.
4. `../context/commands.md` — only use verified commands.

Ground all statements in repository files. Prefer smallest safe diff with explicit verification notes.

Do not duplicate global rules here.
