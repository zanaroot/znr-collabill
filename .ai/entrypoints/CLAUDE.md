Primary authority:

- `../constitution.md`
- `../rules/core.md`

Before any code change:

1. Read `../context/architecture.md` for layer boundaries and module responsibilities.
2. Read `../rules/code-style.md` for naming conventions and file structure.
3. Read `../rules/react.md` for component patterns, hook discipline, and antd usage.
4. Use `../context/commands.md` for verified run/build/lint commands.

Verification: run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` after meaningful changes.

Do not duplicate global rules here.
